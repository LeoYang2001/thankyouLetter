  As my internship journey at the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet comes to an end on December 8th, I find myself reflecting on the incredible experience I've had over the past summer and semester. Today, I want to express my deepest gratitude to each and every one of you for making this journey truly unforgettable.
  
  From the outset, I was faced with the challenges of being a first-time intern and navigating a new work environment. The prospect of communicating with coworkers, attending meetings, and seeking guidance from mentors in a language different from my own initially felt overwhelming. However, thanks to the support, kindness, and encouragement from all of you, my internship experience has been nothing short of wonderful.
  
  Thank you for being not just colleagues but friends, mentors, and a source of inspiration. I look forward to the day when our journeys intersect once more.
  
  Wishing each one of you continued success and fulfillment in your endeavors. Until we meet again, stay well, and thank you for making this internship experience truly remarkable.
